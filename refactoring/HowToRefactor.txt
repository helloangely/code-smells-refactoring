- baby steps
  - make a few code changes and run tests
- "First, Do No Harm" -- Hippocrates
- goal is NOT to:
  - break anything
  - make anything worse
  - introduce new behavior
- take small, reversible steps
- refactor safely
  - automated tests help to know you're not breaking anything
- the rhythm of refactoring
  - verify tests pass
  - decide what code to change
  - implement one or more refactoring carefully
  - run tests often to confirm changes are not impacting system behavior
  - repeat until refactoring is complete / revery to previous state
  - VIDEO: "the code was broken for too long"
  - "The tests are run frequently and pass frequently."
  - "Compilation errors are fixed in a timely manner."
  - got paint card wrong, thought should be extract and guard clauses
- easiest way to understand regex is the tests
- use simpler regex expressions when complex ones are not needed
  - match > find
  - split > re.split
  - pre-compile regex if doing it in a loop
