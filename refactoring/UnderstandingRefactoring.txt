- change made to internal structure
- makes it easier to understand
- cheaper to modify
- no change in observable behavior
- usually involves:
  - removing dupe code, dead code
  - simplifying complex code
  - clarifying unclear code
- revision
  - when we re-see code, we make a choice if we want to improve it or not
  - rewriting is throwing out code and writing it from scratch
  - COLLABORATION!
