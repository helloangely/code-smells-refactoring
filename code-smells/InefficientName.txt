Where the streets have no name
- not optimized for the way programmers work
- waste a second of time for everyone who looks at the code
- programmers usually do three things: reading, scanning (macro level), writing
- usually spend more time scanning code
- change code so its easier to scan
- reveal intention of the person using it
  - describe what we intend the variable to do, rather than how it was set
  - describe why someone would want to use a method rather than what it does
  - answer the WHY we are doing this question to the reader
  - why would someone call the method or use the variable
  - class names easily explain inputs
- choose simple, consistent, and accurate variable names.
- don't shorten variable names
- rename code
  - try not to use inline code that does not reveal intention
  - rather, make it a separate function
  - make the variable's lifetime small as possible
  - extract lots of of the code if its a complex method
  - break up a large class into subclasses

---confusing:
most code smells make it more difficult to scan
- from video: "when you meet code smells they are making your code more scannable or less scannable"
also i don't know...methods are also useful to make code reusable
