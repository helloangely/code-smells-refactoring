- Don't use comments to explain your code
- You code should be intention-revealing, self-documented
- So much that you don't need comments anymore
- Better to refactor code than writing comments
- Tests should help reveal expected behavior
- Comments provide intent no expressed by code
- Should not duplicate what code says
- Code should express intent of comment
- Got this one wrong:
 - Comments are used to generate documentation for an API that is used by thousands of developers.
