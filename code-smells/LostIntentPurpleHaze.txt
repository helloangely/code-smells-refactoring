lost intent
- goal: communicate author's intention
- code purpose clear vs complex logic / obscure
- directories are organized / make sense
- each step in an algorithm defined vs blended together
- code is independent of side-effects of operations + functions
- constructors should be clear so instances are obvious to make
- code with lots of conditionals and purposes is confusing
- common to have terrible variable names and complex methods
