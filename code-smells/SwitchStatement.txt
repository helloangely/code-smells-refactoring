- should consider polymorphism when you see switch statements
- especially when comparing against the same value
- multiple if/elif statements on the same variable:
  - move code to subclasses
- don't move code into subclasses if it will be one liner
- dictionaries work pretty well to replace switch statements
  - works when different data based on a key
