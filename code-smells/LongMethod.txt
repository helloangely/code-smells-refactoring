- Need to quickly and easily understand methods
- Also how the function does it
- Shorter member functions are:
  - Readable
  - Easier to share
  - Easier to test
- OOP programs that live longest have short member fns
- When you have to study the code to figure out what it does
- Break up long methods so you can figure out what it does it seconds
- Don't worry about performance
- Why people write long methods:
  - Scattered code anxiety: don't want to jump around to figure out how code works
  - It's the coding culture
