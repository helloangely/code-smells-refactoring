- well designed classes encapsulate data
  - with methods that act upon that data
- but a class that only contains data
  - may or may not be an example of this code smell
- "dumb data holder" is another name for data class
- but sometimes you want a data class (data transfer object)
- data class is a good idea when:
  - loose coupling between tiers (UI vs business logic)
  - distributed objects (pass across a network)
- sometimes we can put data classes with methods that act on the data
