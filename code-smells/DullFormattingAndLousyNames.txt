- nonstandard formatting
  - python use pep8
- lousy names for variables, classes, methods:
  - should be concise
  - describe intended use
  - pronounceable
- overblown solutions
   - use complex means to solve a problem when simpler approach would suffice
   - ex. using regex vs. python library
   - lesson: use simple approaches
